# Flutter Notes App (Learning Project)

This is a sample notes application built with **Flutter** for learning purposes.

The project demonstrates use of the following key packages and patterns:

- [Cubit (flutter_bloc)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): for simple and scalable state management.
- [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive): for lightweight, local key-value database storage.
- [flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil): for responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete notes.
- Persistent notes storage using Hive.
- Responsive layout using `flutter_screenutil`.
- State management with Cubit for a clear and reactive UI architecture.
